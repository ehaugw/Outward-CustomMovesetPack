# Features

"Custom Moveset Pack" implements three new weapon behaviours, which are assigned to a weapon by applying the following tags (this is done automatically by the mod):

**Bastard**
These are the slow and heavy weapons that were originally held in one hand. Weapons tagged with [Bastard](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/CustomMovesetPack/ "Bastard") feature a dynamic "grip", which has the following benefits:

* Held in one hand, but will be swung with two hands if the left hand is available.
* Receives a juicy damage bonus when swung in two hands
* The two-handed animation is speeded up to take the same time as a one-handed swing animation.

**Finesse**
These are the fast and lightweight one-handed weapons. Weapons tagged with [Finesse](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/CustomMovesetPack/ "Finesse") have the following benefits:

* Their regular stationary special attack is replaced with a swift tripple attack combo that can be chained into other attacks.

**Holy**
These are the weapons that has a lore related reason to be holy weapons. Weapons tagged with [Holy](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ehaugw/CustomMovesetPack/ "Holy") have the following benefits:
